# Python Warmup Exercises

## The Exercises
The exercises here will test your familiarity with a few core Python concepts, and serve as a warm up exercise for anyone that hasn't coded in Python for a while. Each exercise has the expected output/behavior in the output section of the corresponding cell.

## Review Material
If you have trouble with this material, I recommend reviewing Python using the W3 Schools course, here:
https://www.w3schools.com/python/
In this format, you can run Python code right in the browser, in-line with the course material.

Going up to/including File Handling covers a lot of the basics. There are also more advanced and domain specific topics in this material, so don't hesitate to save it as a reference for later!
